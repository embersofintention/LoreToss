# Lore  

## Visual presentation 
in cannon, they always appear in the **visual style of a doodle.**  
- No color, no definition that would make them look 3D.  
- From whatever angle they are looked at, they will be **perceived as flat and hand doodled to the observer**

### presentation within the story
- in the story, at first this is presented as just a style change in the art for the sections that break away to their little stories.  Sort of like chibi side things, to lighten the mood in between chapters
- only when the narrative reaches the point where Ralien and his Rapscalliens are brought to interact directly, face to face, do we see that they *literally* look like doodles.
- this is when we would begin to learn about what they really are, where they come from, why they exist, etc 


#### What are they *really*? 
- embers of Intention met with Ralien's mental imagery of a recently doodled self portrait, likely during a strong emotion mind state, and was influenced by his strong desire to better understand just what the heck goes on in that chaotic mess of his inner world.  

- born of this were the Rapscalliens, or rather, the Inksworn 

### About the name
- **ink**, because they are doodles, and representative of that creativity
- **sworn**, because their purpose is sacred and important -- *even if it may not always look or feel that way*, especially when they're making a mess or being little gremlins 


- the ink they are made of is actually **Intrinsia** -- link to a note explaining all of that later.


- they may come off as a mess, an inconvenience, a problem sometimes... 
- ... But their purpose in doing so is essential 
- they show Ralien clearly the parts of his inner experience that can often be very hard for many of us to decipher, observe, or understand 
- they take the things going on inside of him and essentially push him into having to learn how to confront their reality 
- and if he wants to have any chance at it going well?  He **needs to learn how to be effective in how he interacts with them.**  

- ignoring his own inner conflicts is not an option.  He can't just pretend they're not there.. he *has* to deal with them.
- and this is why as a character he is able to grow so much, and become so much more than he was.


###  Metaphor 

 all of this is a direct #metaphor for how I have come to feel about my own experiences with mental health
- **I've been able to reach where I am now because it forced my hand into *having* to deal with it** 
	- figure things out, 
	- find my direction, 
	- accept help, 
	- fall down again and again and keep getting back up to keep opening my heart to possibility,
	- etc

Observing the alternative 
- I know many people who honestly really would benefit from dealing with their own mental health, but have been *able* to choose to ignore it.  
- I've watched the results of this influence them to grow stubborn, set in their various ignorant and self destructive ways.  
- It's *not* a good look on anyone, and unfortunately it's a frequent one to see
-  ((I absolutely still fall into this too, far more often than I would like.  And I am trying very hard to work through it all with self awareness, though it does not always work))
- we have to deal with our inner stuff to grow.  Otherwise we just exist within a cycle of doubling down and reinforcing our own things, like an echo chamber of our own maladaptive survival strategies that we've settled on. 



-  my shit getting as bad as it did was awful, no two ways about it.  ... And now at least, *I do believe that it had to*.  
- it set my journey into motion, and put me on my path.  

 - **if several things hadn't all happened....**
	- reaching one of the lowest points of my life
	- experiencing my will completely shatter
	- honestly being at a point where I was prepared to die soon at my own hand 
	- being willing to trust my wonderful therapist in their referral to the trauma recovery program that I otherwise would have never likely done, were I not so far gone otherwise 
 - .... **Then I would not have reached this point, to realize my life's purpose** 

*I needed the experience* of my Rapscalliens becoming truly unavoidable.  

My little Inksworn really have been integral.
