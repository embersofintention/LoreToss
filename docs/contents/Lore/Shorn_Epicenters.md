## #Description 

- the areas immediately surrounding where the Gilded Fissures fracture the earth 
- raw Intention boils beneath the surface, casting hints of its peculiarity through its own light

These areas are **unpredictable and dangerous** (as their name suggests)
- stray embers of intention flicker from within, running a constant risk of strange effects and events to follow
- it can be very difficult to tell what is real there, vs what may have been either fabricated or influenced by the Intention
