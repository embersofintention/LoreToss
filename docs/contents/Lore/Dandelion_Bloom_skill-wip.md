# (name pending) -- Dandelion Bloom Skill Thingie That Ralien Does Sometimes :O 


* A supporting skill unique to Ralien (and his unusual composition), that both utilizes and bolsters Intention, motivation, etc



## Symbolism, Meanings, Implication
* **Resilience** -- 
	* Dandelions are notoriously stubborn weeds that bloom how and where they wish.  
	* Try as one might to keep them down or get rid of them, they just come right back at the first opportunity
	* **This is the intention behind this skill:   Imbuing allies with the resilience** to stay strong, not give up, and **claim success under even the most impossible odds**.  



## **Needed for casting:**  
* a small object (pebble, etc), suitable to serve as a "seed"

## **Process**:

### Preparation:  **Seed Germination**
* The "seed" is briefly held and focused on, imbuing it with Intention -- both figuratively and literally.  
	* He must keep his focus firmly on the energy that he wishes to share; if not, the effect will not work, and the seed will be empty

* During this, the seed is rolled about between his paws.  
	* As hands have many points where they must flex and bend, his paws have many cracks within his firm material to allow for this movement.  
	* These little fissures, like any of his others, are filled in and held together by the rubbery wax-like material that is created when bits of passing Intention are exposed to time and solidify.  
	* The normal effects of physical contact with raw Intention would not apply, as the wax is hardened and solid.  HOWEVER, the act of rapidly rolling it about between his paws creates just enough friction to soften it up *just a bit*, allowing for a tiny bit of its essence to coat the tiny object.  
	* This trace amount of coating is what serves to transform an otherwise seemingly worthless little object into the catalyst from which this magic blooms forth.  

### Casting:  **Root Development** and growth
* Once imbued, the seed is tossed into the fray.  Ideally, thrown down within close range to as many allies as possible.  
* It will **take root where it falls**, becoming very difficult to move through normal means (until its effect is fully spent, and the seed returns to being whatever it was before).  
	* These roots are spiritual in nature, more concept than literal, and cannot normally be seen (except by those who normally carry the ability to see spirits and the like)
* The seed itself will then appear to float upwards a few inches.  However, it is in fact being carried up by the **growth of its stem**, which is similarly of spiritual nature and invisible to the typical eye.  
* In some cases, **leaves may also sprout from its stem**, which can be gathered by the especially skillful for use in healing remedies and potions.  

*Over the duration of a minute or so, the seed will bloom into a dandelion with firey petals



### Active Stage: **Flowering Bloom** 
* **Each petal of this firey golden flower is a peculiarity**, and a small miracle of Ralien's own odd consistency: 
	* From the seed, **the *tiniest* little ignited Embers of Intention flicker outwards** for a very brief moment.
	* With enough of these tiny little sparks radiating outwards from that center point, it **creates the golden flaming petals** of a brilliant flower

*As it blooms, the energy it was imbued with during creation will **radiate outwards like heat to touch his allies** with the intended effects of his wish for them.  

**A few notes on its effectiveness...**
* This effect will continue **for the duration of its life cycle**, and taper out once the seed's imbued energy is spent.   
* However, since the effects are psychological, the **bolstering effects *may* carry on far longer** within those who were touched. 
	* This would depend entirely on the individual, their own will, their own desires, and how much affinity the two may share.  
	* The closer of a connection shared between Ralien and the receiver, and **the more in sync their energy and desires are**, the more likely for this ability's effects to continue even long after the bloom has wilted. 

*The bloom's duration can vary, but will generally last between one and several minutes.  
Just before the energy tapers out entirely, the final stage of the ability will begin.  

### End Stage:  **Energy Dispersal**
*(A single dandelion flower can produce 150-200 seeds)*

During this stage, the yellow flower transforms into the familiar **white puffball of seeds** at the end of a dandelion's life cycle.   
*Here is how it happens...*

**Strands:** 
* As each tiny flicker of Intention travels from its seed bed outwards to where its energy flickers out, it leaves behind a very thin strand of that rubbery wax residue that happens when Intention passing through a space is exposed to enough Time to solidify the path it's travelled. 
	* These strands are hollow, and thin enough to be translucent.  
	* In numbers, they will look fluffy and white.  
	* (These share many properties of **fiber-optic strands**, including their ability to carry light down their lengths!)

**Seeds:**
* As the Intention will have lingered longest at the seed before its embers flickered outwards, many strands will extend outwards from any given origin spot. 
	* **These spots form little hardened wads of material,** each with upwards of 100 bristles created by this process.  
	* **These wads become the new seeds**, with their bundles of bristling strands forming the puffy white parts of the dandelion that carry them on the wind.  


### Aftermath
*(And a bit of meta context / explanation)*

It only takes a bit of breeze to knock these seeds off into the wind, and carry them off to land elsewhere.  **Each one that lands holds the possibility to take root, and begin the cycle anew.**  

This is where the **real power of sharing our Intention** lies:  In the ways it can ripple out, and spread farther than we think.  
* This part of the process is out of our control, and often we will never even come to know just how far out the influence of that one initial casting has spread.  
* That's okay, though! We need only really concern ourselves with that initial bit of energy that we choose to put out into the world.  To hope that our intention carries farther is but a comforting addition, to think about in quiet moments.  

**A single casting** may result in a single flower, a small handful, or maybe transform the entire area into a field of golden glow.  Who knows!  **It will depend on the conditions**, and on the receptiveness of living things within the area.  Those who are in tune with what is cast through these embers of intention add their own energy into the mix, as newly forming seeds will be imbued through as much as they may absorb through them.
