- Rapscallien and Zu Nugg mini episodes break up the more serious tone of the main story, with their off-beat antics and silly fun
- we discover over time that these are actually depicting the process of experiencing (and struggling with) the emotions happening during the main story



 **Rapscalliens are depictions of Ralien's mental process.**  His thoughts, observations, emotions, etc


 
 - one may notice that **after these mini chapters, Ralien's mental state may be different** than it was where they last left off 
 - **this is by design**, (not a consistency error, as we led to initially wonder): 
	 - a reflection of how he would be affected by the ways that his inner parts behaved and interacted 
	 - this is to **model the differences in how these processes can affect us**, and those around us.
